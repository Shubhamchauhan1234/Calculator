    <h1>Sellow Copy & Deep Copy </h1>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;color: black;">Sellow Copy</h3>
     <p>  A shallow copy is a copy that only goes one level deep. In other words, it copies the object and all its 
properties, but any nested objects or arrays will stillreference the same memory location as the original 
object. It means that if you make changes to the nestedobject, it will also affect the original object, 
as well as the copied object.
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;color: black;">Deep copy</h3>
        
       <p> A deep copy is a copy that creates a new object with new memory locations for all of its properties 
        and nested objects or arrays. It means that if you make changes to thecopied object or any of its  
        nested objects or arrays,it will not affect the original object
        we use JSON.stringify() to convert originalObject to a JSON string, and then use JSON.parse() to convert
         that string back to a new object deepCopy.It creates a deep copy of originalObject.
